Well, well, well, well, well!
Lemme get a look at the menagerie!
You must be Amethyst
You must be Garnet
And Pink Diamond's Pearl, well, she took you with her, isn't that just swell? <br>
[Pearl:]
It can't be! <br>
[Spinel:]
Oh, but it can be!
And it is!
I got a new style and a few new toys that are gonna put an end to your happily ever after, once and for all! <br>
[Steven:]

[Spinel:]
Yeah, yeah, I've heard. I've had your little message to the universe on LOOP! I just love that part, where Pink Diamond spends the rest of her days on this nowhere planet with a bunch of nobodies!
That's right I heard the story over and over again
Gee, it's swell to finally meet her other friends
That's right I heard the story, don't really like how it ends
Gee, it's swell to finally meet her other friends
What did she say about me? What did she say?
What did you do without me? What did you do?
Did you play games without me? What did you play?
Did you think all this time that I wouldn't find out about you?
That's right I heard the story over and over again
Gee, it's swell to finally meet her other friends <br>
[Garnet:]
She's running circles around us! <br>
[Amethyst:]
I'm rusty, give me a break! <br>
[Pearl:]
It really is her, but she can't be serious! <br>
[Steven:]
You know her, Pearl? Can you tell us who she is? <br>
[Spinel:]
Who am I? Who am I? What are you even saying?
I'm the loser of the game you didn't know you were playing!
Let's play another game this time I get to win
Lives on the line
Winner takes all
Ready or not
Let's begin!
Oh, that's right I heard the story over and over again
Gee, it's swell to finally beat her other friends
Oh, that's right I heard the story, don't really like how it ends
Gee, it's swell to finally beat her other
Other
Other friends <br>
